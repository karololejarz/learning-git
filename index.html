        <p>In the year 3535<br>
        Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lie<br>

      <div class="5555-stanza">
        <p>In the year 5555<br>
        Your arms hangin' limp at your sides<br>

        Some machine's doin' that for you</p>
      </div>
      <div class="6565-stanza">

      <div class="7510-stanza">
        <p>In the year 7510<br>
        If God's a-coming, He oughta make it by then<br>

      <div class="8510-stanza">
        <p>In the year 8510<br>
        God is gonna shake His mighty head<br>

        Or tear it down, and start again</p>
      </div>
      <div class="9595-stanza">
        <p>In the year 9595<br>
        I'm kinda wonderin' if man is gonna be alive<br>
        He's taken everything this old earth can give<br>
        And he ain't put back nothing</p>
      </div>
      <div class="last-stanza">
        <p>Now it's been ten thousand years, man has cried a billion tears<br>For what, he never knew, now man's reign is through<br>
        But through eternal night, the twinkling of starlight<br>So very far away, maybe it's only yesterday<br></p>
